## Thirdweb

### Add your own collection with thirdweb using .csv file.

![alt text](./githubImages/thirdweb-main.png)

#### Example structure for CSV file <br>

**Requirements**

- Files must contain one .csv or .json file with metadata. [Download example.csv](https://thirdweb.com/example.csv). [Download example.json](https://thirdweb.com/example.json).
- The csv must have a `name` column, which defines the name of the NFT.
- Asset names _must_ be sequential 0,1,2,3...n.[extension]. It doesn't matter at what number you begin. (Example: `131.png`, `132.png`).<br>

**Options**

- Images and other file types can be used in combination.
- They both have to follow the asset naming convention above. (Example: `0.png` and `0.mp4`, `1.png` and `1.glb`, etc.)
- When uploading files, we will upload them and pin them to IPFS automatically for you. If you already have the files uploaded, you can add an `image` and/or `animation_url` column and add the IPFS hashes there. Download example-with-ipfs.csv<br>
  [Download example-with-ipfs.csv](https://thirdweb.com/example-with-ipfs.csv)<br>

  <br>

#### I found it helpful to order images by `tags`<br>
